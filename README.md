# MA_EMPEM_mAb_discovery_hmm_merger

Code to merge together .hmm files generated by modelangelo.
Use this code to merge .hmm files together

Both **getarray.py** and **aaprobtohmm.py** should be placed in the same folder that Modelangelo was ran in
i.e. the parent folder to 'output'
getarray.py will look in ./output/hmm_profiles for the .hmm files that you requested to merge

Edit aaprobstohmm.py to select which .hmm files you'd like to stitch.

```
#Define the list of .hmm filenames and integers
hmm_filenames = ["BG.hmm",2,"A0.hmm"]
```

In this example you will stitch together BG.hmm with an insertion of 2 random amino acids then A0.hmm
aaprobtohmm.py will call on the getarray.py and generate a concatenated probability array.
This aray will then be run through modelangelo's orignal ump_aa_logits_to_hmm

```
# Call get_array and get the concatenated array
concatenated_array = get_array(hmm_filenames)

# Use the concatenated array as input to dump_aa_logits_to_hmm_file
dump_aa_logits_to_hmm_file(aa_logits=concatenated_array, output_file="heavyassembled.hmm")
```
